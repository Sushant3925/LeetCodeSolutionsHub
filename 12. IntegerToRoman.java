// Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

// Symbol	Value
// I	1
// V	5
// X	10
// L	50
// C	100
// D	500
// M	1000
// Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

// If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
// If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
// Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
// Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

//  Input: num = 3749

// Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

// Explanation:

// 3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
//  700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
//   40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
//    9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
// Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
// Example 2:

// Input: num = 58

// Output: "LVIII"

// Explanation:

// 50 = L
//  8 = VIII
// Example 3:

// Input: num = 1994

// Output: "MCMXCIV"

// Explanation:

// 1000 = M
//  900 = CM
//   90 = XC
//    4 = IV

//The problems looks like hard as we see length of question But it quite easy Lets do solution;
//Steps;
// 1. we know what are the symbols in roman for every digit place like unit,tens or hundreds and so on.
// 2. Declcare the possible values of each place till 0-9;
// 3. Access them using devide and reminder 

class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
      //Declare possible values at each place
        String units[] = {"","I","II","III","IV","V","VI","VII","VIII","IX"};
        String tens[] = {"","X","XX","XXX","XL","L","LX","LXX","LXXX","XC"};
        String hunds[] = {"","C","CC","CCC","CD","D","DC","DCC","DCCC","CM"};
        String thous[]= {"","M","MM","MMM"};
    //Access those values on the basis of number or index found at each array
        return thous[(num/1000)]+hunds[(num%1000)/100]+tens[(num%100)/10]+units[(num%10)];
    }
}
